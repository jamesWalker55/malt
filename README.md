# Malt - Multiband Sidechain Plugin (Abandoned)

![](mockup.png)

_(^ Mockup design, not actual product)_

This was intended to be a multiband-sidechain plugin, where each band can have a different curve, attack/release times.

However, the `nih-plug` framework is not mature enough and I've run into some roadblocks:

- Text input does not work on Windows (https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/issues/154, https://github.com/RustAudio/baseview/issues/192)
- Window is not resizable
- TODO: list all roadblocks

## Actual progress
